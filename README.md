# Guess Number [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/angrylearners/guessnumber-go.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/angrylearners/guessnumber-go)

An alternative implementation of number guessing game, in go. 

> The Goal:The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. 
> The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) 
> If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong 
> (e.g. The number is too high or too low). 
> If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear. 
> You’ll need functions to check if the user input is an actual number, 
> to see the difference between the inputted number and the randomly generated numbers, 
> and to then compare the numbers.

## How to Play

Compile the program with:
```shell script
go get github.com/angrylearners/guessnumber-go
